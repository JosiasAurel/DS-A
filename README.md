# Data Structures and Algorithms

This is my repository where I will be uploading my progress while re-learning Data Structures and Algorithms with implementations in C/C++.

The code here is written will be separated into directories depending on whether I took into consideration performance (Algorithmic Complexity) or not.

> âš  The code has not been optimized yet.

## Setting Things Up

- Make sure you have the GNU/GCC compiler installed and is available to `PATH` environment variable.
- Also make sure you have `make` installed on your machine.
- Clone this repository or download the code as a zip file.
- Navigate to the directory of this repo

```shell
cd DS-A
```

- Go to the source

```shell
cd src
```

- To build the source, in the `src` diretory run `make build`
  I have already written instructions on how to build and run the code in the `Makefile`.
- Run the code with `make run`
  I have written instructions on running the code too.
